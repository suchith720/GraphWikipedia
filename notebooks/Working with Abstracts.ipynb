Sutermeister.  It is considered “one of the most detailed documentations about [[miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]] in the German language”. < ref > Gilliéron, G. \\'\\'Strafbefehlsverfahren und plea bargaining als Quelle von Fehlurteilen.\\'\\' Zurich: Schulthess, 2010, p. 15. {{ISBN|978-3-7255-6021-9}} < /ref >   It is inspired by [[Voltaire]]′s early activism against French miscarriages of justice of puritan origin, as well as by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]′s criminalistic approaches. < ref > Sutermeister H M. \\'\\'Summa Iniuria.\\'\\' 1976, pp. 38–40 and 119–121. < /ref > \\n \\n ==Plot summary== \\n The book proposes a legal reform for Switzerland which has never been realized because of political controversies.  The [[Maria Popesco|Maria Popescu]], [[Jaccoud case|Pierre Jaccoud]], and [[Vera Brühne]] cases are discussed in detail, as Sutermeister was involved in the criminal researches.  The [[George Edalji]] case serves, among others, to illustrate the issue of faulty expertises.  The main part consists of the so–called “Hirschberg test”, based on [[Max Hirschberg]]s categories of causes of judicial errors. \\n \\n ===Hirschberg test=== \\n The “Hirschberg test” begins with critique against the preliminary inquiries concerning [[Josef Issels]] and [[Bruno Gröning]]. \\n \\n The phenomenon of mis-identification are illustrated by the [[Courrier de Lyon case|Joseph Lesurques]], Billy Armstrong, [[Adolf Beck case|Adolph Beck]], [[Hilsner Affair|Leopold Hilsner]], [[Menahem Mendel Beilis]], [[Sacco and Vanzetti]], [[Joe Hill]], [[Caryl Chessman]], Charles Townsend, [[James Hanratty]], [[John Dickman]], [[Rubin Carter]], Jerome Frank, [[Will Purvis]], [[Anna Anderson]] cases, a large list of experiences which led to wrongful court decisions and which serve to illustrate also other items of the “Hirschberg test”. \\n \\n The issue of uncritical assessment of [[Plea|guilty plea]] is illustrated by the cases of [[Timothy Evans]], [[Harold Israel]], [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], [[Albert DeSalvo]], [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Mata Hari]], [[Renate von Natzmer]], [[Escobedo v. Illinois|Danny Escobedo]], [[Richard Speck]], and [[Alfred George Hinds]], among others. \\n \\n In the chapter about the impact of fellow convicts on dispensation of justice is considered the judgment of [[Barbara Graham]]; and concerning the witness account, the [[Felix Fechenbach]] case, the [[Guillaume Affair]], and the cases of [[Antoine Argoud]], [[Serge and Beate Klarsfeld|Beate Klarsfeld]], Milan Bogunovic, [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof]], [[Raoul Villain]], [[Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley]], and [[Maximilian Kolbe]].  In the cases of [[Marguerite Steinheil]], [[Leo Frank]], [[Sam Sheppard|Samuel Sheppard]], [[Karl Stauffer-Bern|Karl Stauffer]], and [[Green Bicycle Case|Ronald Light]], the lies of the accused would have offered guilty proof. \\n \\n [[Circumstantial evidence]] lawsuits are illustrated by the cases of [[Frederick Seddon]], [[Marie Besnard]], [[Steven Truscott]], [[Graham Young|Graham Frederick Young]], and some [[white-collar crime]]s.  Suggestibility and emotional biases of the jury as causes of wrongful court decisions are shoewd by the cases of Jesse Hill Ford, [[Joan Little]], and [[Alger Hiss]]. \\n \\n The relationship between miscarriages of justice and [[public morality]] are analysed through the cases of [[Henriette Caillaux]], [[Ruth Ellis]], [[Sir Ewan Forbes, 11th Baronet]], [[Hawkhurst Gang|Arthur Gray]], [[Horst Schumann]], [[Joan Barry (American actress)|Joan Berry]], Baader-Meinhof, [[Timothy Leary]], [[Patty Hearst|Patricia Hearst]], [[Kurt Gerstein]], [[Paul Grüninger]], [[Rudolf Roessler]], [[David Frankfurter]], [[Pyotr Grigorenko]], [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], [[Derek Bentley case|Derek Bentley]], [[Edith Thompson and Frederick Bywaters|Edith Thompson]], [[Ivar Kreuger]], [[Stavisky Affair]], [[Harald Feller]], [[Carl Lutz]], [[Viola Liuzzo]], [[Wilma Montesi]], [[Horst Wessel]], among many others. \\n \\n The case of [[Jacques Isorni]] serves to illustrate certain relationship between law and ethics. \\n \\n The author concludes by briefly analysing other aspects of misleading or other judgments revising the [[John T. Scopes|John Thomas Scopes]], [[Carl von Ossietzky]], [[Theodor Lessing]], [[Bruno Lüdke]], [[Persecution of Jehovah\\'s Witnesses in Nazi Germany]], [[Hans Paasche]], [[Ludwig Quidde]], and [[White Rose|Weiße Rose]] cases. \\n \\n ==Reception== \\n The book has the appearance of a patchwork obtained by stitching together legal and controversial political parts, as has been criticized by German jurist [[Klaus Volk]] < ref > [[Klaus Volk]].  \" Buchbesprechung: Sutermeister, H. M.. Summa Iniuria. \"  In: \\'\\'Monatsschrift für Kriminologie und Strafrechtsreform\\'\\'.

Neville orders the group to get the camels ready and get out of the canyon because it\\'s like a box. Miriam leads them to a place that is a necropolis to the old kings and a place her father and brother don\\'t trust. Alphonse is clipped by a ricochet from a bullet fired from a Bedouin\\'s rifle. The Bedouins made an occasional charge but were driven back without much effort. Occasionally they dragged a wounded comrade. On the third day, Neville comes up with a plan\\' to escape. He has Miriam and Alphonse dress him as a mummy. Miriam runs to the Bedouins and tells them that they woke up the mummy. When Neville points at a person Eddie shoots them. The Bedouins run off. After they return to Cairo, Alphonse returns to Germany while Neville returns to England and Eddie becomes a native. \\n \\n Ten years later, Jenny Benet, a recently orphaned American girl who lived on the Wild West has been sent to live with Uncle Neville after her parents were killed by Indians while she was being educated at a Boston finishing school.

He returns it to Mrs.Travers. Then they get a letter from The Sphinx. \\n \\n The boat lands in Cairo and the passengers gets ride from the Travers Family on a military train heading to a military base. Audrey and her group stays at Sheppard’s while Neville and his group stay at Papa Antonio’s hotel. He turns out to be an old friend of Neville. Neville gets a letter from The Sphinx. \\n \\n Neville and Jenny are attacked by men wearing [[Anubis]] masks. The attackers escape.
