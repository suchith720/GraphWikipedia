If one or two people spent some time to seriously review the article, we could perhaps get it back to featured-article status but this would require an ongoing effort as well because it is a frequent target of vandalism.  It is on my watchlist but so are so many other articles that I often do not catch edits that reduce its quality.

      "353 b\"'''Humor Monastery''' located in [[M\\xc4\\x83n\\xc4\\x83stirea Humorului]], about 5&amp;nbsp;km north of the town of [[Gura Humorului]], [[Romania]]. It is a [[monastery]] for nuns dedicated to the [[Dormition]] of Virgin Mary, or [[Theotokos]]. It was constructed in 1530 by Voievod [[Petru Rare\\xc5\\x9f]]  and his chancellor [[Teodor Bubuiog]]. The monastery was built over the foundation of a previous monastery that dated from around 1415. The Humor monastery was closed in 1786 and was not reopened until 1990.\\n\"\n",

      "358 b\"Humor was one of the first of [[Moldavia]]'s painted monasteries to be frescoed and, along with [[Voronet Monastery (Bucovina, Romania)|Vorone\\xc5\\xa3]], is probably the best preserved. The dominant colour of the frescoes is a reddish brown. The master painter responsible for Humor's frescoes, which were painted in 1535, is one ''Toma of Suceava''.\\n\"\n",
      "359 b'\\n'\n",
      "360 b\"The subjects of the frescoes at Humor include the ''Siege of Constantinople'' and the ''Last Judgment'', common on the exterior of the painted monasteries of Bucovina, but also the ''Hymn to the Virgin'' inspired by the poem of Patriarch [[Sergius I of Constantinople|Sergius of Constantinople]] relating to the miraculous intervention of the [[Theotokos]] in saving the city from Persian conquest in 626. The Persians are, however, depicted as Turks which is a common device in these monasteries, their paintings being used in part for political propaganda in addition to their spiritual meaning.\\n\"\n",

It is a [[monastery]] for nuns dedicated to the [[Dormition]] of Virgin Mary, or [[Theotokos]]. It was constructed in 1530 by Voievod [[Petru Rareş]]  and his chancellor [[Teodor Bubuiog]]. The monastery was built over the foundation of a previous monastery that dated from around 1415. The Humor monastery was closed in 1786 and was not reopened until 1990. \\n \\n The church has been inscribed by [[UNESCO]] on its list of [[World Heritage Sites]], as one of the [[Churches of Moldavia|Painted churches of Moldavia]]. \\n \\n ==Frescoes== \\n Humor was one of the first of [[Moldavia]]'s painted monasteries to be frescoed and, along with [[Voronet Monastery (Bucovina, Romania)|Voroneţ]], is probably the best preserved. The dominant colour of the frescoes is a reddish brown. The master painter responsible for Humor's frescoes, which were painted in 1535, is one ''Toma of Suceava''. \\n \\n The subjects of the frescoes at Humor include the ''Siege of Constantinople'' and the ''Last Judgment'', common on the exterior of the painted monasteries of Bucovina, but also the ''Hymn to the Virgin'' inspired by the poem of Patriarch [[Sergius I of Constantinople|Sergius of Constantinople]] relating to the miraculous intervention of the [[Theotokos]] in saving the city from Persian conquest in 626. The Persians are, however, depicted as Turks which is a common device in these monasteries, their paintings being used in part for political propaganda in addition to their spiritual meaning. \\n \\n ==Gallery== \\n < gallery > \\n File:Humor Monastery, Romania.jpg|Humor monastery church \\n File:Humor Monastery Tower.JPG |The tower \\n File:Humor monastery4.jpg|Interior \\n File:Humor monastery3.jpg|Interior \\n File:Humor murals 2010 29.jpg|Exterior \\n File:Humor murals 2010 01.jpg|Murals \\n File:Humor murals 2010 24.jpg|Murals \\n File:Humor murals 2010 05.jpg|Murals \\n File:Humor murals 2010 04.jpg|Murals \\n File:Humor murals 2010 28.jpg|Murals \\n File:Humor murals 2010 14.jpg|Murals \\n < /gallery > \\n \\n ==External links== \\n * Kocój E., Świątynie, postacie, ikony.

The film was the American film debut of Yugoslavian actor Fehmiu and was shot in Europe and parts of South America. It is loosely based on the life of Dominican diplomat and playboy [[Porfirio Rubirosa]]. \\n \\n ==Plot== \\n Dax Xenos, a ten-year old boy in the [[South America]]n country of Corteguay, witnesses the rape and murder of his mother by government soldiers and runs to his father, Jaime, who is with a band of revolutionaries. Jaime\\'s men capture the government soldiers, give Dax the privilege of personally executing his mother\\'s murderers, and then take the boy to their hideout in the mountains where he meets Amparo, the daughter of revolutionary leader Rojo. After the rebels oust the dictator and establish Rojo as president, Dax accompanies his father to Rome, where Jaime is to serve as ambassador. \\n \\n Years later, Jaime returns to Corteguay to find that Rojo has established himself as dictator; he contacts El Condor, the new revolutionary leader, but is killed by Colonel Gutierrez, Rojo\\'s security chief. Dax, now a young man, returns to Corteguay for his father\\'s funeral. Rojo persuades Dax, who does not know the cause of his father\\'s death, to convince El Condor to surrender, but when El Condor surrenders, he is killed by Gutierrez. \\n \\n Because his promise to El Condor was betrayed, Dax murders Gutierrez, confronts Rojo with his treachery, and returns to Rome. He becomes a gigolo and finally marries millionairess Sue Anne Daley, but they soon divorce. Dax again returns to Corteguay, this time for the unveiling of a statue of his father, and finds himself thrust into yet another revolution. \\n \\n Led this time by El Lobo, the revolution succeeds when Dax murders Rojo. Meanwhile, Dax learns that Amparo has borne him a son. Delighted, he sends her back to Rome with the intention of establishing a democracy in Corteguay and returning to his new family, but he is assassinated by the vengeful son of El Condor. \\n \\n ==Cast== \\n {{castlist| \\n *[[Bekim Fehmiu]] as Dax Xenos \\n **Loris Loddi as young Dax \\n *[[Charles Aznavour]] as Marcel Campion \\n *[[Candice Bergen]] as Sue Ann Daley \\n *[[Alan Badel]] as President Rojo \\n *[[Thommy Berggren]] as Sergei Nikovitch \\n **Carl Eklund as young Sergei \\n *[[Delia Boccardo]] as Caroline de Coyne \\n *[[Ernest Borgnine]] as Fat Cat \\n *[[Rossano Brazzi]] as Baron de Coyne \\n *[[Olivia de Havilland]] as Deborah Hadley \\n *[[Anna Moffo]] as Dania Leonardi \\n *[[Leigh Taylor-Young]] as Amparo Rojo \\n **Roberta Donatelli as young Amparo \\n *[[Christian Roberts (actor)|Christian Roberts]] as Robert \\n **[[Anthony Hickox]] as young Robert \\n *[[Fernando Rey]] as Jaime Xenos \\n *[[Yorgo Voyagis]] as El Lobo \\n *[[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]] as James Hadley \\n *[[Jorge Martínez de Hoyos]] as El Condor \\n *[[Sydney Tafler]] as Col.

There were two other systems, called IPSO-SX and IPSO-LX, that were Linux-based: \\n \\n * \\'\\'\\'IPSO SX\\'\\'\\' was Nokia\\'s first release of a Linux-based IPSO, and was deployed in 2002 on the now-defunct Message Protector, < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=880176|title = The latest Nokia phones and accessories  & #124; Nokia Phones US}} < /ref >  and briefly thereafter on a short-lived appliance version of the  \" Nokia Access Mobilizer \" , acquired from [[Eizel]].  It had a partitioning scheme somewhat reminiscent of IPSO SB, a [[LILO (boot loader)|LILO]] configuration and [[boot manager]] also somewhat inspired by IPSO SB, and a software package installer that made [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] packaging look more familiar to a Nokia IPSO administrator.  It did not, however, include a full configuration database or Voyager web interface, the two things that normally define IPSO. \\n * \\'\\'\\'IPSO LX\\'\\'\\' is a nearly [[Vanilla (computing)|vanilla]] [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]-based Linux OS, < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.secinfo.com/dsvRq.uu2.a.htm|title = SEC Info}} < /ref >  and is used on Nokia appliances sold with [[Sourcefire]] 3D.  It includes a full Voyager and database implementation—in fact, the Voyager look and feel in IPSO SB 4.0 onwards was based on that implemented for IPSO LX. \\n \\n Check Point offers three lines of security appliances - one based on IPSO 6.x, one based on an operating system called SecurePlatform and the latest based on Gaia platform (RHEL4 based). \\n \\n === Features === \\n \\n IPSO notable features or firsts include: \\n * Effective firewall load-balancing (in conjunction with [[Check Point]] synchronization), derived from Network Alchemy [[cluster (computing)|clustering]] technology, predating and still independently developed from Check Points [[ClusterXL]]. \\n * The first commercial [[IPv6]] [[router (computing)|router]] out of [[beta-testing]] (ahead of [[Cisco]] and [[Juniper Networks]]) \\n * Firewall Flows for putting Check Point security rule implementation into the dedicated network processor circuitry on-the-fly (though this is now largely evolved into Check Point\\'s SecureXL) \\n \\n === Versions === \\n IPSO SB was originally derived by [[Ipsilon Networks]] from FreeBSD 2.1-STABLE and cross-compiled on FreeBSD 2.2.6-RELEASE and 3.5-RELEASE platforms. Its major components are: \\n *  A configuration database held in memory by the  \" xpand \"  daemon, that creates legacy UNIX configuration in /etc on-the-fly. \\n *  A [[disk partitioning|partitioning scheme]] which places a mini-IPSO in a separate boot manager partition for recovery \\n *  A partition-slicing scheme which segregates read-only and read-write content \\n *  A software packaging scheme which requires all packages to remain in a single location under /opt \\n *  A web interface, Voyager, which was closely integrated with the configuration database. (It has now diverged somewhat.) \\n \\n IPSO versions up to 2.x were sold by Ipsilon Networks as part of the [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] tag-switching solutions that they originally pioneered.  IPSO 3.0 onwards were designed to host Check Point [[FireWall-1]] and other third party packages. \\n \\n IPSO 3.0 to 3.9 spanned from 1999 to 2005 and, while adding many features and significant performance and hardware refinements, were recognizably the same to the administrator. \\n \\n IPSO 4.0 was not designed as a major update and was internally numbered as IPSO 3.10.  However, Check Point software was unable to process a two-digit dot version, and it also included a refresh of the Voyager HTML interface. Up to that point, [[JavaScript]] and [[framing (World Wide Web)|frames]] had been avoided in order to facilitate the use of [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]] as a command line interface.  These together resulted in it being renumbered as 4.0. \\n IPSO 4.1 and IPSO 4.2 are incremental releases. IPSO 4.2 will gain source-based routing as its last scheduled new feature. All new development will continue on IPSO 6.x. \\n \\n IPSO 5.0 build 056 was released in 2009 for VSX R65 support on IP Appliance. \\n \\n IPSO 6.0 was announced by Nokia in relation to the IP2450 and IP690 hardware. It is based on FreeBSD 6.x. Its primary advantage over IPSO 4.x are improved memory management, performance, scheduling, threading, POSIX-compliance, and other operating system features. IPSO 6.0.7 was released in 2009 for IP690 and IP2450 with CoreXL (multi-core) support. IPSO 6.1 contains other enhancements from FreeBSD 6.x but without CoreXL support. Because of the step change, Nokia advertised that IPSO 4.2, 6.07 and 6.1 will run alongside each other for a period of time. When Check Point acquired Nokia IP appliance business, 6.07 and 6.1 development branches were merged and combined to 6.2. \\n \\n Most recent version is IPSO 6.2MR6, released in February 2017. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?action=portlets.DCFileAction & eventSubmit_doGetdcdetails= & fileid=44605|title = Support, Support Requests, Training, Documentation, and Knowledge base for Check Point products and services}} < /ref > \\n \\n For a while, Nokia offered IPSO 7, which was actually IPSO LX.  It was discontinued after 7.2, in 2008. \\n \\n After acquiring the Nokia IP appliance business, Check Point announced project Gaia to combine both IPSO and Secure Platform.

Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding [[amazons|amazon]], [[Tyris Flare]], whose parents were killed by Death Adder. \\n \\n Progress is made through the game by hacking and slashing your way through Adder\\'s forces. Aiding the characters in this quest is their ability to cast [[magic (gaming)|spells]] that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of  \" bars \"  of magic power currently available.  The bars are filled by collecting blue \\'magic potions\\' found throughout the game. The male warrior Ax, limited to 4 bars, is able to cast Earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, limited to 3 bars, casts lightning spells. The female warrior Tyris can cast devastating fire magic, but her most powerful spell costs 6 bars. \\n \\n ===\\'\\'Golden Axe II\\'\\'=== \\n {{main|Golden Axe II}} \\n Each of the heroes from the first game return to battle the forces of evil villain Dark Guld in this sequel. While \\'\\'Golden Axe II\\'\\' was a [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] exclusive from a development point of view, it saw limited arcade exposure in the [[MegaPlay]] series of arcade machines. Released in 1991, the game featured new magic for each of the heroes with the characteristic magic pots from the first game replaced by spell books this time around. \\n \\n Many video game magazine editors of the time expressed that the game was very likely rushed into production to give Sega another popular title to enable the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] to compete with its new rival, the [[Super NES]]. In most respects this sequel was essentially the same as the original, though it had new sprites for enemy characters and new levels.  Many fans were disappointed with this title as they were expecting more than a rehash of the first title. However, the title had the virtue of not straying too far from a successful formula and was still quite popular upon its release. \\n \\n ===\\'\\'Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder\\'\\'=== \\n {{main|Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder}} \\n In 1992, Sega released \\'\\'Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder\\'\\' in arcades. Despite its popularity, the game remained an arcade exclusive up until its appareance in 2020 on the Astro City Mini < ref > {{cite web |url =https://www.siliconera.com/astro-city-mini-cabinet-coming-from-sega/ |title =Astro City Mini Cabinet Coming From Sega|publisher =Siliconera |access-date =10 Jul 2020}} < /ref >  and Arcade1Up\\'s smaller scale recreation of the original [[arcade cabinet]]. \\n \\n Only Gilius Thunderhead makes a return, riding the back of new character Goah the giant. The rest of the cast is all new and includes Stern Blade the barbarian, Dora the female [[centaur]], and Little Trix, a young lad who carries a pitch fork. The main enemy is once again Death Adder. \\n \\n As well as introducing multiple paths to the franchise, the magic aspect was adjusted. Though still found in the classic \\'\\'Golden Axe\\'\\' pots, the magic spells did not increase in power with the number of pots collected but required a set number to work. \\'\\'The Revenge of Death Adder\\'\\' was the only \\'\\'Golden Axe\\'\\' game in which one of the magic attacks was not offensive, as Little Trix grew apple trees with fruit that replenished health. \\n \\n At the game\\'s end, Death Adder rises one more time. Gilius sacrifices his life to finally end Adder\\'s. During the end cinematic Gilius is shown in a bar with every other character, and a banner appears saying,  \" See you Next Game! \" \\n \\n ===\\'\\'Golden Axe III\\'\\'=== \\n {{Main|Golden Axe III}} \\n Released in 1993, after \\'\\'Revenge of the Death Adder\\'\\', the third \\'\\'Golden Axe\\'\\' game on the Mega Drive was released only in Japan. However, the game was available for a while in North America on the [[Sega Channel]], Sega\\'s [[modem]]-based game downloading system. It was brought to Europe and North America on the [[Nintendo Wii]]\\'s [[Virtual Console]]. The game\\'s lineup of playable characters includes swordsman Kain Grinder (カイン・グリンダー), swordswoman Sarah Barn (サラ・バーン), giant Braoude Cragger (プラウド・クラッガー) and beastman Chronos  \" Evil \"  Lait (クロノス・”イビル”・レート). Gilius also appear as a non-playable character at the character select screen. \\n \\n In this game the object is to travel along a number of truly branching paths and eventually defeat the main boss of the game, the Prince of Darkness. The player can choose different branching paths in this game toward that objective just as in \\'\\'Revenge of Death Adder\\'\\'. The paths in this game are more elaborate and do not loop back together. Many of the characters are good characters that were possessed, and once beaten they are freed. A king turned into an anthropomorphic eagle is a recurring boss who may possibly be Prince Hellbringer\\'s right-hand man, and is playable in VS mode. \\n \\n As opposed to \\'\\'Golden Axe II\\'\\', where the characters, moves, and controls remained largely the same, \\'\\'Golden Axe III\\'\\' brought many changes to the gameplay. The background scenery was less lush and colorful than in previous games, as were the sprites themselves. There was a greater variety of moves. Furthermore, there were several abilities unique to certain characters: for example, the Braoude could throw, while the Chronos and Sarah could double jump and wall jump. Finally, each character had a super-move with its own unique button combination. \\n \\n Some features were returned to the title that had been cut in previous sequels. \\'\\'Golden Axe III\\'\\' brought back the thieves from the original game, rather than the mages from \\'\\'Golden Axe II\\'\\'. Also, extra lives could be gained by freeing prisoners scattered throughout the levels. The magic system was returned to the original version where all pots are used at the same time, as opposed to the improved system in \\'\\'Golden Axe II\\'\\' that allowed the player to only use as many spellbooks as they wanted. \\n \\n Critics applauded Sega\\'s decision not to release \\'\\'Golden Axe III\\'\\' in North America, speculating that the game\\'s drab graphics and generally mediocre quality would have damaged the Sega Genesis\\'s reputation. < ref > {{cite news|title=Golden Axe III|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=53|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=December 1993|page=110}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Lucas M.|title=Golden Axe III Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/20/golden-axe-iii-review|website=[[IGN]]|access-date=2 October 2014|date=November 19, 2007}} < /ref > \\n \\n ===\\'\\'Golden Axe: Beast Rider\\'\\'=== \\n {{Main|Golden Axe: Beast Rider}} \\n The game is titled \\'\\'Golden Axe: Beast Rider\\'\\' and features the return of Tyris Flare, the female [[Amazons|amazon]] warrior from the first installments of the series. \\'\\'Golden Axe: Beast Rider\\'\\' was released in October 2008. \\n \\n ==Spin-offs== \\n \\n ===\\'\\'Golden Axe Warrior\\'\\'=== \\n {{Main|Golden Axe Warrior}} \\n \\n This [[Master System]] title tells another epic tale about the Golden Axe. It is an action-adventure game similar to \\'\\'[[The Legend of Zelda (1986 video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]\\'\\'. The storyline continues the theme of the original \\'\\'Golden Axe\\'\\' games. The game\\'s unit of [[currency]] is horns, and it is to be imagined that the hero cut these off of the enemies he killed. \\n \\n ===\\'\\'Ax Battler: A Legend of Golden Axe\\'\\'=== \\n {{Main|Ax Battler: A Legend of Golden Axe}} \\n \\n Released for the [[Game Gear]], this action-adventure title follows the legend of the character Ax Battler. Unlike its console counterpart, it is based more on \\'\\'[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]\\'\\' than the original game. The player moves around a top-view overworld and enemies randomly attack. However the player can not see them like in \\'\\'Zelda II\\'\\'. When a battle begins, the transitions to a platform-style fighting environment. After killing the foe (or the foe wounding them) the hero returns to the overworld. \\n \\n Unlike previous \\'\\'Golden Axe\\'\\' games, the player can learn new attacks and moves at the training dojos in each town. The currency in this game is pots, the traditional \\'\\'Golden Axe\\'\\' magic-usage item. Pots double as both currency and as an offensive attack. \\n \\n ===\\'\\'Golden Axe: The Duel\\'\\'=== \\n {{Main|Golden Axe: The Duel}} \\n \\n Released in 1994 in the arcades and in 1995 for the [[Sega Saturn]], \\'\\'Golden Axe: The Duel\\'\\' is a one-on-one fighting game featuring characters who appear to be descendants of some of the characters in the original game. Though the potion-dropping imp mechanic was praised, most dismissed the game as a decent but nondescript one-on-one fighter. < ref > {{cite news|last=Guise |first=Tom |title=Review: Golden Axe: The Duel|work=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=2|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=December 1995|pages=80–81}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news|title=Golden Axe: The Duel Review|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=84|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=July 1996|page=26}} < /ref > \\n \\n ==Cancelled prototype== \\n The Sega Reborn project was originally planned for development by [[Sega Studios Australia]] in the early 2010s, which would have included 2.5D reboots of the original game, along with those of \\'\\'[[Streets of Rage]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[Altered Beast]]\\'\\'. However, the project cancelled after Sega Studios Australia closed down in 2013. As part of Sega\\'s 60th anniversary celebration, a working proof-of-concept prototype of the planned \\'\\'Golden Axe\\'\\' reboot, posthumously titled \\'\\'Golden Axed: A Cancelled Prototype\\'\\', received a limited one-day release on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] on October 18, 2020. < ref > https://store.steampowered.com/app/1368460/Golden_Axed_A_Cancelled_Prototype/ < /ref > \\n \\n The release of the prototype received controversy from fans and critics when one of its original developers, Tim Dawson, spoke up in opposition to the lack of any credits on the cancelled game. He also took issue with the fact that the game was described as  \" buggy \"  and  \" janky \"  when it was actually created under [[Crunch time (video gaming)|crunch]] conditions, and that, as a fan of the series, he had worked  \" long 7 day work weeks \"  on developing it before it was arbitrarily cancelled for lacking a  \" wow factor \"  and being too different from \\'\\'[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]\\'\\', making him feel  \" dead inside \" . This led to Sega Europe issuing an apology and modifying the game\\'s description to remove the offending text, saying that it was a comment on that version of the game rather than the quality of the work itself. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Dealessandri|first=Marie|date=2020-10-15|title=Sega criticised for launching Golden Axe prototype created  \" under crunch conditions \" |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-15-sega-criticised-for-launching-golden-axe-prototype-created-under-crunch-conditions|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-19|website=GamesIndustry.biz|language=en}} < /ref > \\n \\n ==Characters== \\n * Ax Battler is a barbarian hero. He uses a [[claymore]] while wearing a loincloth and blue boots as well as iron [[bracer]]s and a [[gorget]]. He calls upon volcanic magic, deploying lava and powerful eruptive blasts. Ax\\'s mother is murdered by Death Adder\\'s forces, providing his motive in the original \\'\\'Golden Axe\\'\\'. Ax was given a solo game for the Sega Game Gear title \\'\\'Ax Battler: A Legend of Golden Axe\\'\\', in which he is charged with saving another kingdom. Battler is the most balanced character, having a better striking range and less spell-power than Tyris, and more powerful magic but not the extended physical reach of Gilius. \\n * [[Tyris Flare]] is an amazon who wields a [[cinquedea]]-type sword while wearing a chainmail bikini, bracers and red boots. Both her parents are murdered by Death Adder\\'s forces, leading her to seek revenge in the first Golden Axe game. Her magic attacks are all fire-based, including the summoning of a giant, flame-spewing dragon. Tyris has the shortest range of the heroes, but possesses the most powerful spells. \\n * Gilius Thunderhead is a bearded dwarf who (at least in the arcade version) actually commands the Golden Axe. He wears a green [[tunic]], leather boots and a [[horned helmet]]. He seeks revenge in Golden Axe after his brother is murdered by Death Adder\\'s forces, returning again to defeat Dark Guld in \\'\\'Golden Axe II\\'\\'.  In \\'\\'Golden Axe III\\'\\', Gilius is the only character from the previous games to appear, though he is not playable, he starts each of the characters off on their quest at the game\\'s beginning. When Death Adder returns from the dead in \\'\\'Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder\\'\\', Gilius rides on the back of playable character Goah throughout the game, and sacrifices his life at game\\'s end to vanquish Death Adder once and for all. Gilius is granted the least powerful spells in the game, but has the best striking range in battle. Gillius is a recurring playable character in the \\'\\'[[Sega SuperStars]]\\'\\' series. \\n * Death Adder is a tyrannical [[giant (mythology)|giant]] who wears a full iron helmet, pointed [[spaulder]]s, and wields an enormous double axe. In addition to his brutal strength and speed while attacking, he can also cast magical spells. With his army, he enslaves the kingdom of Golden Axe and kidnaps its royal family.  After dispatching his minions, Adder is finally killed by the game\\'s three heroes, but is resurrected for \\'\\'Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder\\'\\'.  Here, he survives an initial attempt on his life but perishes due to the self-sacrifice of Gilius Thunderhead. Death Adder reappears many years later in \\'\\'Golden Axe: The Duel\\'\\', where he is a playable character, and the penultimate boss. In 2010, [[IGN]] ranked Death Adder 83rd in  \" Top 100 Videogames Villains \" .{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} \\n * In home console versions of \\'\\'Golden Axe\\'\\', Death Adder is accompanied by his son, Death Adder Jr., and father, Death Bringer. These characters are [[palette swap]]s of the original Death Adder [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]], with similar powers and abilities. In the Genesis sequels, \\'\\'Golden Axe II\\'\\' and \\'\\'Golden Axe III\\'\\', Death Adder\\'s role is filled by Dark Guld and Damud Hellstrike, both of whom bear a strong resemblance to Death Adder. \\n \\n ==Other appearances== \\n The characters from the original \\'\\'Golden Axe\\'\\' have made cameo appearances in other Sega games. Ax Battler, Gilius Thunderhead and Tyris Flare all make a cameo appearance in the arcade version of \\'\\'[[Alien Storm]]\\'\\'. They can be found on one of the in-game television screens; a \\'\\'Golden Axe\\'\\' logo can also be seen during that cameo. Gilius Thunderhead makes another cameo appearance in the game, as part of a panel of judges rating the player\\'s score. \\n \\n Gilius Thunderhead is also a playable character in \\'\\'[[Sega Superstars Tennis]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[Sonic  &  All-Stars Racing Transformed]]\\'\\'. The latter also features a racetrack inspired by Golden Axe called  \" Adder\\'s Lair \" . Ax Battler and Tyris Flare are available as playable characters in the Easy Mode of the \\'\\'[[Sega Ages]] 2500\\'\\' version of \\'\\'[[Dynamite Deka]]\\'\\'. Death Adder also makes an appearance as one of the game\\'s bosses. \\n \\n Chickenleg, the pink [[cockatrice]] with the tail lash from the first game, first appeared as an enemy in \\'\\'[[Altered Beast]]\\'\\'. \\n \\n ==In other media== \\n \\n ===Film and TV projects=== \\n In 2014, Sega formed the production company Stories International and teaming up with Evan Cholfin for film and TV projects based on their games with \\'\\'Golden Axe\\'\\' as an animated project with [[Universal Studios]] developing as a movie or TV series. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/sega-taps-evan-cholfin-to-adapt-its-videogames-for-films-tv-digital-platforms-exclusive-1201377268/|title=Sega Taps Evan Cholfin to Adapt its Videogames for Films, TV, Digital Platforms (EXCLUSIVE)|author=Marc Graser|date=December 11, 2014|work=Variety|access-date=December 11, 2014}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://segabits.com/blog/2015/09/01/rumor-universal-studios-on-track-to-make-a-movie-or-tv-show-based-on-segas-golden-axe/|title=Rumor: Universal Studios Onn Track To Make A Movie or TV Show Based On Sega\\'s Golden Axe|publisher=Segabit|author=Barry the Nomad|date=September 1, 2015}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/asia/altered-beast-streets-of-rage-sega-movies-shows-1201933661/|title=Sega\\'s \\'Altered Beast,\\' \\'Streets of Rage\\' Games to Be Adapted for Film, TV|author=Dave McNary|date=December 5, 2016|work=Variety|access-date=2016-12-05}} < /ref > \\n \\n Gilius makes frequent appearances in the 2014 anime \\'\\'[[Sega Hard Girls|Hi-sCoool!

By this point, however, the French-built [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] had conducted its [[maiden flight]] during the previous year, and BEA was beginning to recognise that jet aircraft could soon be providing stiff competition. < ref name =  \" wood 100 \" > Wood 1975, p. 100. < /ref > \\n \\n In April 1956, Anthony Milward, chief executive of BEA, stated that he  \" would rather do without [jet airliners] \" . Nevertheless, in December of that same year [[Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|Lord Douglas of Kirtleside]], BEA\\'s chairman, stated that  a number of jet-powered short haul aircraft might need to be introduced while retaining turboprop aircraft as the mainstay of the company\\'s inventory for the foreseeable future. < ref name =  \" wood 100 \" / >  In July 1956, BEA had announced what it called  \" outline requirements \"  for a short-haul  \" second-generation jet airliner \" , to work alongside its turboprop fleet.

[[Vickers-Armstrongs|Vickers]] proposed the VC11 four-engined airliner, derived from its in-development [[Vickers VC10|VC10]]. The {{nowrap|de Havilland}} company considered three possible contenders for the specification; two of these were four-engined developments of the early [[de Havilland Comet|Comet]], the world\\'s first jet-powered airliner: the D.H.119 and the D.H.120, the latter being also intended to be offered to [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC). In July 1957, de Havilland made another submission in the form of the DH.121; this proposal was furnished with three [[turbojet]]s, [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engines, and greatly resembled the eventual production aircraft. < ref name =  \" wood 102 \" / >  By August 1957, the DH.121 proposal had been revised; differences included the adoption of the in-development [[turbofan]], the [[Rolls-Royce Medway]], and an expansion to accommodate a maximum of 98 passengers. < ref name =  \" wood 102 \" / > \\n \\n The DH.121 was to be the world\\'s first [[trijet]] airliner. Its designers felt this configuration offered a trade-off between cruising economy and take-off safety in case of an engine failure; moreover, the BEA specification had called for  \" more than two engines \" . Each of the three engines would drive its own hydraulic system, offering triple redundancy in case of any of the other systems failing. The engines were to be 13,790 & nbsp;lbf (61.34 & nbsp;kN) Medway engines. The DH.121 was to have a [[Maximum takeoff weight|gross weight]] of {{convert|123000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} or optionally, up to {{convert|150,000|lb|kg}}, a range of {{convert|2070|mi|km|abbr=on}}, and seating for 111 in a two-class layout (or for over 140 in a high-density, single-class layout as typical from the 1960s onwards on inclusive-tour [[charter airline|charter]] flights). < ref name =  \" wood 97 102 \" > Wood 1975, pp. 97, 102. < /ref >  The design initially included a [[cruciform]] tail layout similar to that of the Caravelle. < ref name =  \" wood 102 \" / >  The engines were clustered at the rear, with the centre engine situated in the extreme rear of the fuselage fed by air ducted through a large oval intake at the front of the fin, a configuration similar to the later Boeing 727; the design eventually settled on a variable-incidence T-tail. < ref > [https://www.scribd.com/doc/991251/NASA-70785main-C2R  \" Deep-Stall Avoidance. \" ] \\'\\'Concept to Reality.\\'\\' Retrieved: 13 November 2010. < /ref > \\n \\n [[File:G-awzk-front.jpg|thumb|Offset nosewheel to accommodate a large avionics bay beneath the flightdeck]] \\n \\n From the outset, the DH.121 was planned to employ [[avionics]] that were very advanced for the period.

De Havilland was keen to retain their independence and leadership of the DH.121, so approached the government with a proposal to form a consortium under which de Havilland would produce the fuselage, Bristol would manufacture the wings, and various other companies, including [[Hunting Aircraft]] and [[Fairey Aviation]], would be responsible for other elements; however, Bristol strongly opposed this arrangement and chose to work with Hawker Siddeley in competition against de Havilland. < ref name =  \" wood 102 103 \" > Wood 1975, pp. 102–103. < /ref > \\n \\n Companies vigorously competed to be selected by BEA due to the lure of its £30 million contract ({{Inflation|UK|30000000|1958|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{inflation-fn|UK}}), as well as the likelihood of lucrative overseas export sales. < ref name =  \" wood 103 \" > Wood 1975, p. 103. < /ref >  On 4 February 1958, de Havilland, along with Hunting and Fairey, announced that they had agreed to form a partnership for the purpose of manufacturing and marketing the DH.121; the consortium adopted the corporate name of the defunct [[Airco]] company, which had been [[Geoffrey de Havilland]]\\'s employer during the [[World War I|First World War]]. < ref name =  \" wood 103 \" / >  The [[Minister of Supply]] stated of the Airco consortium that  \" this is not quite what [he] had in mind \" . Nevertheless, both Airco and the rival Bristol-Hawker Siddeley team proceeded to conduct their own approaches to various overseas airlines; sufficiently interested, American [[Pan American World Airways]] invited both teams to present their proposed airliners in January 1958. < ref name =  \" wood 103 \" / >  Sir [[Matthew Slattery]], chairman of Bristol and [[Short Brothers]], appealed for BEA to delay any decision until after one of the competing firms had already secured an export order for their airliner. In response, Lord Douglas stated that BEA wished to order the DH.121 and was awaiting approval from the government; Douglas\\'s reply has been viewed as the [[death knell]] for the rival [[Bristol Type 200|Type 200]] proposal. < ref name =  \" wood 103 \" / > \\n \\n Meanwhile, a rival airliner emerged, this time from [[Boeing]] in the United States, in the form of the [[Boeing 727|727]], which also had a trijet configuration. < ref name =  \" wood 104 \" / >  Boeing had begun its studies into this sector of the market in 1956, and elected to launch its own trijet programme in 1959.

It had three rear-mounted engines: two in side-fuselage pods, and the third in the fuselage tailcone, with an [[S-duct|S-shaped intake duct]].

All versions were powered by versions of the [[Rolls-Royce Spey]], while the boost engine was a [[Rolls-Royce RB162]], originally intended as a lift engine for [[VTOL]] applications. \\n \\n The Trident was one of the fastest subsonic commercial airliners, cruising at over {{convert|610|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. At introduction into service its cruise Mach Number was 0.88/ 380 kn [[indicated air speed|IAS]].

This, and the aircraft\\'s low thrust-to-weight ratio, called for prolonged takeoff runs. Nevertheless, the Trident fulfilled BEA\\'s {{convert|6000|ft|m|abbr=on}} field length criterion and its relatively staid airfield performance was deemed adequate before the arrival into service of the Boeing 727 and later jet airliners built to {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}} field length criteria. < ref > \" Talking to Mr. Beall: Boeing\\'s Senior Vice-President in London. \"  \\'\\'Flight International,\\'\\' 14 October 1960, p. 603. < /ref >  The aerodynamics and wing was developed by a team led by [[Richard Clarkson]], who would later use the Trident wing design as the basis for the wing of the [[Airbus A300]]; for the Trident he won the [[Mullard Award]] in 1969. \\n \\n The Trident normal descent rate was up to 4500 & nbsp;ft/min (23 & nbsp;m/s). In emergency descents of up to 10,000 & nbsp;ft/min, it was permissible to use reverse thrust. Below 280 & nbsp;kn IAS, it was also possible to extend the main landing gear for use as an airbrake. The Trident\\'s first version, Trident 1C, had the unusual capability of using reverse thrust prior to touchdown. The throttles could be closed in the flare and reverse idle set to open the reverser buckets. At pilot discretion, up to full reverse thrust could then be used prior to touchdown. This was helpful to reduce hydroplaning and give  very short landing runs on wet or slippery runways while preserving wheel brake efficiency and keeping wheel brake temperatures low. Brakes were fitted with the [[Maxaret|Dunlop Maxaret]] [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-skid]] system. \\n \\n ===Avionics=== \\n [[File:TridentFlightDeck.JPG|thumb|Flight deck of a Trident 2E: there are orange  \" Triplex autoland fitted \"  placards on the control columns and the [[moving map display]] on the centre instrument panel]] \\n \\n The Trident had a complex, sophisticated and comprehensive avionics fit which was successful in service.

BEA planned to buy 10 1Fs, plus an [[Option (aircraft purchasing)|option]] for 14 further aircraft. \\n \\n As work continued on the 1F the changes became so widespread that it was renamed the \\'\\'\\'Trident 2E\\'\\'\\', E for \\'\\'Extended Range\\'\\'. Now powered by newer Spey 512s with 11,930 & nbsp;lbf (53.1 & nbsp;kN) thrust, it also replaced wing [[leading-edge droop flap]]s with slats, and extended the span with [[Dietrich Küchemann|Küchemann]]-style tips.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} It had a gross weight of {{convert|142400|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|2000|mi|km|abbr=off}} range. \\n \\n BEA bought 15, < ref > [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WlxAAAAAIBAJ & sjid=jaMMAAAAIBAJ & pg=5065,767205  \" BEA orders more Tridents. \" ] \\'\\'Glasgow Herald\\'\\', 6 August 1965. < /ref >  while two were bought by [[Cyprus Airways]]. CAAC, the Chinese national airline, bought 33. The first flight of this version was made on 27 July 1967 and it entered service with BEA in April 1968. \\n \\n ===Trident 3B=== \\n [[File:British Airways Trident Marmet.jpg|thumb|The Trident 3B, stretched by {{cvt|5|m}} for up to 180 seats]] \\n \\n Subsequently, the Trident was becoming the backbone of BEA\\'s fleet and BEA wanted an even larger aircraft. {{nowrap|Hawker Siddeley}} offered two new designs in 1965: a larger 158-seat two-engine aircraft otherwise similar to the Trident known as the HS132; and the 185-seat HS134, which moved the engines under the wings, a design very similar to the [[Boeing 737]]. Both were to be powered by a new high-bypass engine under development at the time, the [[Rolls-Royce RB178]]. BEA instead opted for [[Boeing 727]]s and [[Boeing 737|737s]] to fill the roles of both the BAC 1–11 and Trident, but this plan was vetoed by the British government. \\n \\n BEA returned to Hawker Siddeley and chose a stretched version of the basic Trident, the \\'\\'\\'Trident 3\\'\\'\\'. A fuselage stretch of {{convert|5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} made room for up to 180 passengers; {{nowrap|Hawker Siddeley}} raised the gross weight to {{convert|143000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and made modifications to the wing to increase its [[Chord (aeronautics)|chord]]; the engines remained the same. BEA rejected the design as being unable to perform adequately in  \" [[hot and high]] \"  conditions, in light of such issues experienced with the Trident 2E. Since the Spey 512 was the last of the Spey line, extra thrust would be difficult to obtain. Instead of attempting to replace the three engines with a completely different type, which would have been difficult with one engine buried in the tail, {{nowrap|Hawker Siddeley}}\\'s engineers decided to add a fourth engine in the tail, the tiny [[Rolls-Royce RB162]] turbojet, fed from its own intake behind a pair of movable doors. The engine added 15% more thrust for takeoff, while adding only 5% more weight, and it would only be used when needed. BEA accepted this design as the \\'\\'\\'Trident 3B\\'\\'\\', and ordered 26. The first flight was on 11 December 1969 and the aircraft entered service on 1 April 1971. Addition of extra fuel capacity resulted in the \\'\\'\\'Super Trident 3B\\'\\'\\'. \\n \\n The Trident experienced some key export sales, particularly to China. Following a thawing of relations between Britain and the [[People\\'s Republic of China]], China completed several purchase deals and more than 35 Tridents were eventually sold. < ref > [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A-FUAAAAIBAJ & sjid=qJADAAAAIBAJ & pg=6757,2106429  \" British bid to sell jets to China. \" ] \\'\\'The Age\\'\\', 10 May 1971. < /ref > < ref > [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hItAAAAAIBAJ & sjid=9KQMAAAAIBAJ & pg=2166,780008  \" After Trident, Concorde? \" ] \\'\\'Glasgow Herald\\'\\', 5 December 1973. < /ref > \\n \\n In 1977, fatigue cracks were discovered in the wings of British Airways\\' Tridents.

[[British Airways]], the type\\'s main operator, saw the required refits as not viable and instead chose to phase the Trident out of their fleet in 1985.

The first such march on Washington, it drew between 75,000 and 125,000 < ref name= \" Ghaziani \" > Ghaziani, Amin. 2008. \\'\\'The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington\\'\\'. The University of Chicago Press. < /ref >  [[gay]] men, [[lesbians]], [[bisexuals]], [[transgender]] people, and [[straight allies]] to demand equal [[LGBT rights in the United States|civil rights]] and urge the passage of protective civil rights legislation. < ref > {{Cite news \\n   | last = Thomas \\n   | first = Jo \\n   | title = 75,000 March in Capital in Drive To Support Homosexual Rights; \\'Sharing\\' and \\'Flaunting\\' \\n   | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] \\n   | pages = A14 \\n   | date = 15 October 1979 \\n   }} < /ref > \\n \\n ==History and Planning== \\n \\n The first major attempt at organizing a national gay and lesbian march on Washington occurred Thanksgiving Weekend 1973 in [[Urbana-Champaign]], [[Illinois]].  The National Gay Mobilizing Committee for a March on Washington (NGMC), organized by Jeff Graubart, attempted to coordinate a coalition of extant [[LGBT]] organizations to plan a March on Washington.  Early efforts were met with resistance from local and national LGBT organizations, < ref > [http://www.rainbowhistory.org/aiken1173.pdf Aiken Papers] < /ref >  and plans for a march were ultimately postponed. \\n \\n The next organization attempt was to occur in Minneapolis the weekend of November 17–19, 1978. < ref name= \" Ghaziani \" / >  A steering committee was created to prepare for the Minneapolis conference, and it identified a primary goal of the march as transforming the gay movement from local to national.  However, the committee was dissolved in October 1978 due to internal dissent. < ref > Gay Community News, November 25, 1978.  \" Committee Dissolves Itself: Planned March on Washington is in Trouble \"  by John Gracak < /ref >   [[Harvey Milk]], who had been on the Minneapolis steering committee, took up the reins to continue march organization, and had secured support from local DC groups who had previously dissented before he was assassinated by [[Dan White]]. Milk\\'s assassination served as a catalyst and a touchstone for organizers, who next planned a conference in [[Philadelphia]] February 23–25, 1979.  One male and one female delegate was invited from known lesbian and gay organizations, and the attendees set forth to address three primary questions.  First, whether or not a march should take place.  Second, what the organizational structure of the march should be.  And third, the platform of the march. < ref name= \" Ghaziani \" / >   An initial debate between marching in 1979 and 1980 sprung up, but 1979 was settled upon as it fell on the ten-year anniversary of the [[Stonewall Riots]]. < ref name= \" Ghaziani \" / >   Once these issues were settled and issues of female and minority representation were handled, the conference set forth five demands that would serve as the platform for the march.  The participants chose to focus on [[single-issue politics]] so as not to dilute the message of a united lesbian and gay community. < ref name= \" Ghaziani \" / >   The final organizational push occurred at a conference at the [[University of Houston]] campus July 6–8, 1979.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} \\n \\n The National Steering Committee, with mandated gender parity and 25% representation of People of Color, was selected by community meetings throughout the country. Policy/Overview and Administrative Committees were established to guide the work and decisions between Steering Committee meetings. The National Office was set up in New York City with Joyce Hunter and Steven Ault as National Coordinators.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} \\n \\n ==Platform== \\n \\n Joe Smenyak of New York City initially drafted Five Demands, later amended by the conference delegates. \\n \\n *Pass a comprehensive lesbian/gay rights bill in Congress \\n *Issue a presidential executive order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal government, the military, and federally contracted private employment \\n *Repeal all anti-lesbian/gay laws \\n *End discrimination in lesbian-mother and gay-father custody cases \\n *Protect lesbian and gay youth from any laws which are used to discriminate, oppress, and/or harass them in their homes, schools, jobs, and social environments < ref name= \" Program \" > http://www.cristanwilliams.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MOWprogram-1979.pdf Program of march < /ref > \\n \\n ==Activities and speakers== \\n \\n The march served to nationalize the gay movement, which had previously been focused on local struggles. < ref name= \" Ghaziani \" / >   This spirit is invoked in the closing paragraph of the welcome program of the march, written by [[Allen Young (writer)|Allen Young]]. \\n \\n \" Today in the capital of America, we are all here, the almost liberated and the slightly repressed; the butch, the femme and everything in-between; the androgynous; the monogamous and the promiscuous; the masturbators and the fellators and the tribadists; men in dresses and women in neckties; those who bite and those who cuddle; celebates[sic] and pederasts; diesel dykes and nelly queens; amazons and size queens, Yellow, Black, Brown, White, and Red; the shorthaired and the long, the fat and the thin; the nude and the prude; the beauties and the beasts; the studs and the duds; the communes, the couples, and the singles; pubescents and the octogenarians.

The march was led by the [[Salsa Soul Sisters]], who carried the official march banner. It was also broadcast live on multiple [[National Public Radio]] affiliates throughout the US. Speakers and artists who spoke at the main rally included [[Harry Britt]], [[Charlotte Bunch]], [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Peter Orlovsky]], [[Florynce Kennedy|Flo Kennedy]], [[Morris Kight]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Leonard Matlovich]], [[Kate Millett]], [[Troy Perry]], [[Eleanor Smeal]], First [[PFLAG]] President [[Adele Starr]], and Congressman [[Ted Weiss]]. < ref name= \" Program \" / >    \\n Mayor [[Marion Barry]] gave a welcome to the marchers on behalf of the city of Washington, DC. < ref name= \" Program \" / > \\n \\n [[Jok Church]] and Adam Ciesielski recorded a documentary vinyl LP of the main speeches at the event.

The Bruins came up one point short of the upset, losing the game 70–71 after Justin Hare\\'s desperation three point attempt barely went wide left of the net. The Bruins rallied from 9 point and 7 point deficits in the second half to take a 70–69 lead late in the game, before Duke scored what proved to be the game\\'s final basket with under a minute left to play. \\n \\n In 2011 Belmont University won the Atlantic Sun Regular Season Championship and the Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament.

Accessed October 11, 2015 < /ref > \\n \\n ==Background and planning== \\n The desire for a national march in the [[LGBT]] community was prompted by two major events in the 1980s: the [[AIDS]] pandemic, the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration\\'s lack of acknowledgment of the AIDS crisis; and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruling in \\'\\'[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]\\'\\' upholding the criminalization of sodomy between two consenting men in the privacy of a home. < ref name= \" Ghaziani \" / >   In 1986, Steve Ault and Joyce Hunter, co-coordinators of the 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]], drafted documents to extant lesbian and gay organizations soliciting interest in a new march. The response was favorable, and the two organized an initial planning meeting in New York City on July 16, 1986, where it was decided that the march would be held in 1987. < ref name= \" Ghaziani \" / >  Representatives from all known lesbian and gay organizations were subsequently invited to a national conference in New York City on November 14–16, 1986 where they would discuss the politics, logistics and organization of the event.  The delegates would be addressing four primary concerns:  \\n #What will a March on Washington accomplish?; \\n #How should organizers and LGBT organizations proceed?; \\n #What should be the focus and platform of the event?; and \\n #When should the March take place? < ref name= \" Ghaziani \" / > \\n \\n The conference was held under the slogan  \" For love and for life, we\\'re not going back! \" < ref > Byron, Peg.  \" Plans for National March Begin Amidst NY-DC Turf Battle. \"  \\'\\'Washington Blade\\'\\'. November 21, 1986 < /ref > \\n \\n Throughout the planning weekend, delegates debated many aspects of the march itself, including the needs of more marginalized members of the community – lesbian and gay people of color, those living in poverty and with disabilities. < ref name= \" Ghaziani \"  / > \\n \\n The second meeting of the steering committee was held in January 1987 in the City of West Hollywood at City Hall. Steve Ault, [[Pat Norman (activist)|Pat Norman]] and Kay Ostberg were elected as the three national co-chairs of the event. < ref name= \" Ghaziani \" / > \\n \\n The final organizational meeting for the march took place in [[Atlanta]] on May 2–3, 1987.  This meeting served primarily to hammer out logistical details and determine the slate of individuals to speak at the rally. \\n \\n ==Platform== \\n The delegates at the West Hollywood convention chose seven primary demands to serve as the platform for the 1987 March.  Each of these demands was supplemented with a broader list of demands which extended beyond the scope of single-issue LGBT concerns.  In doing so, the organizers wished to underscore their recognition that oppression of one group affects oppression of all groups. < ref name= \" Ghaziani \" / >   The seven primary demands were: \\n \\n *The legal recognition of lesbian and gay relationships. \\n *The repeal of all laws that make sodomy between consenting adults a crime. \\n *A presidential order banning discrimination by the federal government. \\n *Passage of the Congressional lesbian and gay civil rights bill. \\n *An end to discrimination against people with [[AIDS]], ARC, < ref > AIDS-Related Complex, or AIDS-Related Conditions. < /ref >  [[HIV]]-positive status or those perceived to have AIDS.

       "  \"'''Solar-like oscillations''' are [[oscillation]]s in distant [[star]]s that are excited in the same way as those in the [[Sun]], namely by turbulent [[convection]] in its outer layers. Stars that show solar-like oscillations are called '''solar-like oscillators'''. The oscillations are standing pressure and mixed pressure-gravity modes that are excited over a range in frequency, with the amplitudes roughly following a bell-shaped distribution.  Unlike opacity-driven oscillators, all the modes in the frequency range are excited, making the oscillations relatively easy to identify.  The surface convection also damps the modes, and each is well-approximated in frequency space by a Lorentzian curve, the width of which corresponds to the lifetime of the mode: the faster it decays, the broader is the Lorentzian.  All stars with surface convection zones are expected to show solar-like oscillations, including cool main-sequence stars (up to surface temperatures of about 7000K), subgiants and red giants. Because of the small amplitudes of the oscillations, their study has advanced tremendously thanks to space-based missions < ref > {{cite journal| title = Asteroseismology of Solar-Type and Red-Giant Stars | year = 2013 | journal = Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics| volume = 51 | pages = 353–392| bibcode = 2013ARA & A..51..353C| doi = 10.1146/annurev-astro-082812-140938 | last1 = Chaplin | first1 = W.

Ott and his company are credited with planning and constructing many buildings and structures in and around [[Bern]], including the [[church field bridge]]. He also supervised the removal of the [[Christoffelturm]], a local tower built in the 14th century. \\n \\n ==Life and family history== \\n Ott's great grandfather had migrated from [[Swabia]] in [[Germany]] to [[Jegenstorf]] in 1782, and it was his grandfather who established the Otts in [[Worb]]. Ott's schooling was based in Bern, and he later studied at the polytechnic institute of [[Karlsruhe]]. After he finished his studies < !--in XXXXX(year?)-- > , he dabbled in several enterprises before opening a private [[construction]] company.  In 1864, this company evolved into ''Ott  &  Cie'', which would become one of the best known and most successful manufacturing and construction outfits of its time, and visibly impacting the city. From there, Ott expanded and was taken into a tight fold of advice on Bern's [[infrastructure]] in 1866, a year after he removed the Christoffelturm. Within this group was [[Jakob Stämpfli]], a well-known Swiss politician. \\n \\n ==Ott in popular culture== \\n A song or ode was written about Ott, inspired by his influence on Bern: \\n \\n {{cquote| \\n ''If you just let dear Ott have his way'' < br > \\n ''and hope in him at all times'', < br > \\n ''for you he will marvelously make thrive'' < br > \\n ''the glory of the state finances''.}} \\n \\n ==Suicide== \\n In 1865, Ott entered politics by joining the [[:de:Burgergemeinde Bern|Burgergemeinde Bern]]. In 1881 he suffered a great political defeat, having lost an election. Coupled with large financial stress, this loss caused Ott to become suicidal. He took his life on 4 December 1882. \\n \\n The suicide was described by the federation: \\n {{cquote|On Saturday evening, December 2, 1882 he sat until 11 o'clock with friends at the hospital. He says good-bye there and heads home, however he did not arrive. The search began on Sunday, on Monday company workers took part in the search. On Wednesday morning, December 6, 1882 his corpse was found in the Aarekanal. The autopsy shows that he had drowned. Since only a small wound at the head was found, the possibility of crime was excluded. His watch showed the time as 02:00 o'clock.}} \\n \\n ==References== \\n *Peter Lüthi-Ott: ''Gottlieb Ott (1832-1882) - Der Erbauer der Kirchenfeldbrücke'', in: Heinrich Richard Schmidt (Hg), ''Worber Geschichte'', Bern 2005, S. 604-607 {{in lang|de}} \\n \\n {{Authority control}} \\n \\n {{DEFAULTSORT:Ott, Gottlieb}} \\n [[Category:1832 births]] \\n [[Category:1882 deaths]] \\n [[Category:People from Worb]] \\n [[Category:Suicides by drowning in Switzerland]]\",\n",

It first aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on October 12, 2006. \\n \\n The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company.

It was completed in 1903 on grounds of {{convert|125|acre}}. \\n \\n The building was loosely patterned upon a French [[chateau]] but fanciful in style, with 99 rooms in a compact, three-story structure ornamented with prominent turrets. Contrary to popular rumors that Mrs. Schell despised the Chateau and refused to live in it, the Schells summered at their beautiful home for 25 years. It was only after the death of her beloved husband in 1928 that Mrs. Schell refused to set foot in the house again, insisting when she stayed at the Northfield Hotel during future summers that she have a room not overlooking the grand house that had been her husband\\'s pride and joy. A server at the Inn overheard her once responding to another guest\\'s compliments of her former home with  \" I hate it; I never go there. \"   \\n \\n After Mr. Schell\\'s death, the mansion fell into disrepair and was eventually sold to the Northfield School for Girls which also owned the Northfield Hotel. They intended to use it as a meeting place and novelty hotel annex; however, it was never practical for hotel use and in the end was demolished in 1963. \\n \\n Until that time, it was used by the Northfield School for Girls as the location of their prom.

With the introduction of the [[second generation of video game consoles|second generation of home consoles]] in the mid-1980s, a new [[black market]] of illegally-imported goods and [[video game clone]]s arose to avoid the high costs of imports, driving away foreign companies. Notably, China imposed a near-complete ban on video game consoles in 2000, fearing the addicting-like impact of games on its youth; the ban was ultimately lifted in 2015. During that time, China\\'s video game market greatly expanded in the area of computer games, including [[massively multiplayer online games]] (MMOs), [[Social-network game|social games]], and [[mobile games]], all which could be [[free to play]] titles with [[Video game monetization|monetization]] to appeal to the average lower income of Chinese players. This massive growth from 2007 to 2013 led the games\\' publishers and operating companies like [[Tencent]] and [[Netease]] to become large global companies. Despite the legitimate growth of the industry, China\\'s video game market continues to be offset by illegal importing and intellectual copyright theft. \\n \\n As with other parts of its media, China\\'s government has strong oversight of the video game industry; all new titles go through a governmental approval process to assure that content aligns with the nation’s values. In 2018, an approvals freeze due to the reorganisation of China’s content vetting agencies caused numerous game releases to be held up. The video game market plummeted for a year. The government also fears the potential for its youth to become addicted to video games, and have required games to include anti-addiction measures. User verification is used to enforce playtime restrictions, which currently limit minors to three hours per week. \\n \\n ==History== \\n Broadly, the growth of the video game market in China is tied to expansion of its [[Science and technology in China|technology and digital economy]] from the 1990s to present day, which by 2016 represented over 30% of its [[gross domestic product]]. < ref name= \" china history \" / > \\n \\n ===Initial growth (1980s-2000) === \\n [[File:Tongyang - downtown - internet cafe - CIMG9869.JPG|thumb|An internet café in Tongyang Town, the county seat of Tongshan County, Hubei.]] \\n At the time that the video game industry was being established in North America in the 1970s, China was [[History of the People\\'s Republic of China (1976–1989)|in the midst of major political and economic reform]] following the death of [[Mao Zedong]] in 1976.

Developers of legitimate games in China recognized that, to compete with this black market, they had to develop games that had a free or low upfront cost model but offered a way to monetize their games over time. Many Chinese-developed games became online games offering numerous [[microtransaction]]s to recoup costs; such games could be offered at Internet cafés, which became a popular option for Chinese players that could not afford computer hardware, even as the price of computing equipment dropped over the next decade. This created a boon of [[massively multiplayer online game]]s (MMOs) in the Chinese market and which helped to establish market dominance of companies like [[Tencent]], [[Perfect World (company)|Perfect World]], and [[NetEase]]. < ref name= \" pcgamer china 2018 \" / >  PC cafes proliferated in urban centers as China\\'s population continued to grow. < ref name= \" pcgamer china \" / >  Western free-to-play and subscription-based games like \\'\\'[[Dota 2]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[World of Warcraft]]\\'\\', poised to take advantage of this model, also became successful. < ref name= \" pcgamer china \" / >  It also prompted Chinese developers to develop numerous [[video game clone|clones]] of popular Western games that they would offer at low cost, an issue that still persist presently. < ref name= \" pcgamer china \" / > \\n \\n Online gaming became of serious concern to the government around 2007, re-raising the issues of gaming addiction that had prompted the 2000 console ban.

World of Warcraft is the most popular western MMORPG in Asia, and one of the most popular in China in general. Recent statistics place its peak concurrent users at around 688,000, easily among the top MMORPGs in the country. < ref > {{cite web|author=Shang Koo|work=Gamasutra|url=http://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=13369|title=The China Angle: Wii Piracy, \\'\\'World Of Warcraft\\'\\' Beaten?|date=April 3, 2007}} < /ref >   The9 also implemented a pay-for-time system for the game, which differs from the monthly subscription payment structure used by Blizzard in other territories.

The first is peak concurrent users (PCU), which is the maximum numbers of players online simultaneously at a given time.  A high PCU number signifies that a game has a large base of constant user participation, which is essential for the survival of an online world.  The second statistic used is the daily active player base; this number is essentially a count of the number of disparate users who sign on in a given 24-hour period.  This statistic differs from PCU simply because of its longer time span but the daily user base is still a good quantifier of popularity and usage. \\n \\n The third statistic is simply the total number of registered users for a specific game or service, this statistic is significantly more problematic because most, if not all, online games do not limit the user to a single account or user name.  For example, some games claim millions of registered users; a disingenuous statistic given that the most popular MMORPGs in China usually garner only 800,000 to one million peak concurrent users. < ref > Gamasutra.[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=13369  \" The China Angle \" ].

Initially impressed by meeting company  \" president \"  Norifumi Suzuki (Shinichi Tsutsumi), Mutsuko is shocked to discover her workplace is actually a shabby auto repair shop in Tokyo\\'s down-at-heel Yuhi district. \\n \\n Suzuki is a bad-tempered employer but Mutsuko is welcomed by his wife, Tomoe (Hiroko Yakushimaru), and their impish 5-year-old son, Ippei (Kazuki Koshimizu). One of Ippei\\'s favorite haunts is a five-and-dime store managed by struggling serial writer Ryunosuke Chagawa (Hidetaka Yoshioka). Regarding now-successful writers like Nobel-prize winner Kenzaburo Oe, as overrated, Chagawa wants to be more than a hack churning out sci-fi yarns and selling cheap toys on the side. \\n \\n When alluring newcomer Hiromi (Koyuki) opens a sake bar in the area, she gathers clientele quickly—in dramatically compressed manga style—but also finds herself lumbered with Junnosuke (Kenta Suga) the orphaned offspring of the bar\\'s previous tenant. Drunk, and smitten by Hiromi, Chagawa accepts custodianship of the boy. \\n \\n ==Reception== \\n The film ranked 15th at the Japanese box office in 2005, < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/market/trend/industrial/pdf/jer0610-2e.pdf |title=Archived copy |website=www.jetro.go.jp |access-date=15 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222004704/http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/market/trend/industrial/pdf/jer0610-2e.pdf |archive-date=22 February 2007 |url-status=dead}} < /ref >  and won 12 prizes at the [[2006 in film|2006]] [[Japanese Academy Awards]], including the awards for Best Film, Director, Actor and Screenplay.

It first aired on January 4, 2007, on [[NBC]], and was the first episode to air after the December holiday hiatus.  \" Back from Vacation \"  was the first script written by [[Justin Spitzer]] for the series. [[Julian Farino]] served as the episode director. \\n \\n The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company.  In this episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) returns from his vacation in Jamaica and has a [[luau]] in the warehouse to celebrate. It is revealed that he went to Jamaica with [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) when a racy photograph of him and Jan is circulated. Meanwhile, [[Karen Filippelli]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) and [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) have an argument over Karen\\'s living situation, leading to [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) offering him advice. \\n \\n According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was watched by an estimated 8.80 & nbsp;million viewers. Among the 18–49 demographic, it earned a 4.3/11 ratings share and helped NBC finish in first place for the night.  \" Back from Vacation \"  received generally positive reviews from critics, with Carell\\'s performance receiving positive attention in particular. \\n \\n ==Synopsis== \\n < !-- Per Wikipedia  \" television episode \"  guidelines [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EPISODE#Plot_summaries], the summary should not exceed ten words per minute of screen time.

When [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) notices [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) in the margins of a photo from Michael\\'s vacation, he admits to the documentary crew that he and Jan went to Jamaica together. \\n \\n Michael attempts to send another vacation photograph to [[Todd Packer]] ([[David Koechner]]) as proof of the trip, but mistakenly chooses  \" Packaging \"  instead of  \" Packer \"  from the address menu, sending the photograph to the entire shipping warehouse, including [[Darryl Philbin]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]), the warehouse supervisor. The photo is quickly forwarded throughout the office and beyond. Michael enlists [[Dwight Schrute]]\\'s ([[Rainn Wilson]]) assistance in preventing its spread, but these efforts are largely ineffective. \\n \\n [[Karen Filippelli]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) has been upset with [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) because he expressed objections to the prospect of Karen moving into an apartment two blocks from his own. Pam convinces Jim that he is being unreasonable, and Jim accepts her advice and apologizes to Karen. Pam tells the documentary crew that she was glad to help Jim, but is then shown later to be crying in private, secretly in love with him and heartbroken over the fact that he is with Karen instead. Dwight walks in on her crying. He awkwardly attempts to console her, although he misunderstands:  \" So, you\\'re [[Premenstrual syndrome|PMSing]] pretty bad, huh? \" \\n \\n During the luau/inventory, Jan arrives at the office to speak with Michael in private. Michael is terrified that Jan is there to confront him over the widely spread photo, but she appears to be unaware of it, instead confessing her attraction to him against all reason and kissing him. \\n \\n ==Production== \\n \" Back from Vacation \"  was written by [[Justin Spitzer]], < ref name=episode > {{cite episode |title=Back from Vacation |series=The Office |series-link=The Office (American TV series) |credits=[[Julian Farino]] (director), [[Justin Spitzer]] (writer) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=January 4, 2007 |season=3 |number=12}} < /ref >  a staff writer who joined \\'\\'The Office\\'\\' in its third season. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a401471/the-office-producer-justin-spitzer-sells-new-comedy-to-nbc.html |title=\\'The Office\\' producer Justin Spitzer sells new comedy to NBC |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |first=Tom |last=Eames  |date=August 23, 2012 |access-date=September 3, 2012}} < /ref >  The episode was his first script for the series. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.film.com/tv/inventory-luau-the-office-is-back-from-vacation |title=Inventory Luau: The Office is Back From Vacation |publisher=[[Film.com]] |date=January 5, 2007 |access-date=September 3, 2012}} < /ref >  Spitzer found Jan\\'s final scene with Michael & nbsp;– in which he expects she will yell at him for their circulated picture but instead informs him they are staying together & nbsp;– especially tricky to write.

In 1986, the brand was involved in a [[cyanide]] poisoning hoax, and its sales never recovered. \\n \\n ==History== \\n \\n Procter  &  Gamble submitted a [[patent application]] on 14 March 1983 for its new line of [[over-the-counter]] micro-granulated aspirin capsules, to be sold under the name Encaprin, chosen for its phonetic similarity to the word aspirin. < ref name= \" case \" > {{cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/smithkline-beckman-corp-v-proctor-gamble-co|title=SMITHKLINE BECKMAN CORP. v.

The ruling sided with Procter  &  Gamble, and they were allowed to keep the Encaprin name. < ref name= \" case \" / >  Success for Encaprin was short-lived, however, as the product faced intense competition from the [[acetaminophen]]-containing [[Tylenol (brand redirect)|Tylenol]] and other aspirin products.  \\n \\n SmithKline Beckman soon had a large measure of revenge despite the loss of the trademark infringement case. Encaprin\\'s roll-out was immediately cursed, as came onto the national market in May 1984, the same month as [[ibuprofen]] was approved for [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] sale. [[Ibuprofen brand names|Advil]], marketed by SKB, along with [[Bristol Myers Squibb|Bristol Myers]]\\'s Nuprin, promptly came to market with ibuprofen\\'s successful ten-year period as a [[prescription drug]] providing a wide runway for positive marketing.

In addition to the competition from acetaminophen and ibuprofen, the regular and buffered aspirin brands of the time (including market leader [[Sterling Drug]]\\'s [[Bayer|Bayer Aspirin]]) then offered newly engineered higher-dose forms of aspirin which provided both pain relief and were easier on the stomach at lower prices, or discounted their products to easily fend off P & G\\'s challenge. \\n \\n Encaprin was soon embroiled in the [[Tampering (crime)|product tampering]] scares following the 1982 [[Chicago Tylenol murders]].

Ideal observer theory stands in opposition to other forms of ethical subjectivism (e.g.[[moral relativism]], and [[individualist ethical subjectivism]]), as well as to [[moral realism]] (which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of anyone\\'s attitudes or opinions), [[error theory]] (which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense), and [[non-cognitivism]] (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all). \\n \\n [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Hume]] espoused versions of the ideal observer theory. [[Roderick Firth]] laid out a more sophisticated modern version. < ref > {{cite journal |title=Ethical Absolutism and the Ideal Observer |first=Roderick |last=Firth |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=12 |issue=3 |date=March 1952 |pages=317–345 |jstor=2103988}} < /ref >  According to Firth, an ideal observer has the following specific characteristics: omniscience with respect to nonmoral facts, [[omnipercipience]], disinterestedness, dispassionateness, consistency, and normalcy in all other respects. Notice that, by defining an Ideal Observer as omniscient with respect to nonmoral facts, Firth avoids [[Begging the question|circular logic]] that would arise from defining an ideal observer as omniscient in both nonmoral and moral facts. A complete knowledge of morality is not born of itself but is an [[Emergence|emergent property]] of Firth\\'s minimal requirements. There are also sensible restrictions to the trait of omniscience with respect to nonmoral facts. For instance, to make a moral judgment about a case of theft or murder on [[Earth]] it is not necessary to know about geological events in another [[Solar System|solar system]]. \\n \\n Those using the ideal observer theory do not usually assert that ideal observers actually exist.

It was renamed as a result of \\'\\'[[sati (practice)|sati]]\\'\\' by Rania, Queen of Bhattian Riasayat\\'s King after she heard a rumour that the king had been killed in a nearby village. \\n \\n After [[Nader Shah\\'s invasion of the Mughal Empire|Nader Shah retreated from India in 1747 CE]], Rania was taken over by the [[Bhatti clan|Bhatti]] [[Ranghar]] [[Rajput]] freebooter Muhammad Hassan Khan took the possession of Rania, Fatehabad and Rania, and he remained in ongoing tussle with [[Jat people|Jat]] [[Sikh]] ruler of [[Patiala State|Patiala]] and [[Jind State]]s for the control of this tract. In 1768 CE [[Johiya]] ranghars chieftain, Kamruddin, another vassal of Bikaner State, took over Rania, Fatehabad and Sirsa. In 1774 CE, Jat Sikh ruler of Patiala State, Amar Singh, snatched the [[paragana]]s of Rania, Fatehabad and Rania from Bhatti Ranghar Rajput chieftain Muhammad Amir Khan, a vassal of [[Bikaner State]], who retreated to his [[Bhatner fort]] ([[Hanumangarh]]). In 1774 CE, [[Mughal empire|Mughal forces]] under [[Mirza Najaf Khan]] and [[Jaipur State|Raja Jai Singh]] signed a treaty with Jat Sikhs and Bikaner state under which [[Tosham#History|Tosham]], [[Hisar (city)#History|Hisar]], [[Hansi#History|Hansi]], [[Meham]] and [[Rohtak]] were restored to Mughals and Raja Jai Singh became Nazim of Hisar [[Sarkar (country subdivision)|sirkar]]; Rania-Fathebad-Sirsa tract was restorrd to Bhatti chiefs under Bikaner state; and Jat Sikhs kept the rest of their territory annexed by them in North Haryana ([[Narwana]], [[Jind]] and [[Kaithal]]). After the death of Najaf Ali Khan, the weak Mughal empire under [[Shah Alam II]] invited [[maratha empire]]\\'s who took over the whole of Haryana by 1792 CE under [[Mahadaji Shinde|Mahadaji Sindhia]]. [[George Thomas (soldier)|George Thomas]] who held this area under Marathas, became independent ruler of this tract in 1798 Ce, but in 1801 marathas empire ruled by [[Daulat Rao Sindhia]], led by their French-origin general [[Pierre Cuillier-Perron]] who allied with Jat Sikhs ruler of Jind, expelled George Thomas from Haryana. Ongoing feud among Bhattis, Johiyas, Jats, Skihs, Marathas and Mughals, weakened them all and this tract came under [[British raj]] in 1803.
